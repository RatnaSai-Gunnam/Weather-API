**Step 1: Deploying the API**
The first thing we want is to make our Flask REST API accessible in a reliable and scalable way. To do that, I’d start by containerizing the app using Docker. This makes sure it runs exactly the same in development and production.
Once the app is containerized, there are two main ways I’d deploy it:
  - ECS Fargate: Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR and run it on Fargate. This gives us automatic scaling without worrying about managing servers.
  - Lambda + API Gateway: For smaller-scale APIs, I could also deploy it serverlessly using Lambda with API Gateway, possibly using tools like Zappa or Serverless.
On top of that, I’d make sure the API is secure—using HTTPS through API Gateway and controlling access with IAM roles or API keys.

**Step 2: Setting up the Database**
Instead of sticking with SQLite, I’d use a managed database like Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL or MySQL). It’s reliable, scalable, and handles failover automatically with Multi-AZ deployments.

The application would connect using environment variables for the host, username, password, and database name. And if the app grows, we can add read replicas to handle read-heavy traffic.

**Step 3: Automating Data Ingestion**
We want to regularly ingest weather data without manual intervention. Here’s how:
  - Option 1: A Lambda function triggered on a schedule via CloudWatch Events. It reads raw data from S3, processes it, and writes it to RDS.
  - Option 2: Run the ingestion script as a Docker container on ECS Fargate, triggered by EventBridge on a schedule.
To prevent issues if a job runs more than once, we use ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE in SQL so the data stays consistent.

**Step 4: Managing Storage**
All raw weather files go into Amazon S3. This makes the data easy to access, and we can set lifecycle policies to archive or delete old files automatically after processing.
By reading directly from S3 in our ingestion jobs, we avoid dealing with local storage, which simplifies the workflow.

**Step 5: CI/CD and Automation**
We want to deploy consistently and safely, so I’d set up a pipeline using GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline would:
  - Build the Docker image
  - Run tests
  - Deploy the image to ECR → ECS Fargate or Lambda
For secrets like database credentials, we can securely manage them with AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

**Step 6: Monitoring and Logging**
Finally, monitoring is key. I’d set up CloudWatch Logs for both the API and ingestion jobs, and configure CloudWatch Alarms to notify us of failures or unusual activity. For the API, AWS X-Ray could help trace requests if we need deeper insight.

**Putting it all together:**
  - The API runs Flask in Docker, deployed to ECS Fargate or Lambda, and is exposed via API Gateway.
  - The database is RDS PostgreSQL/MySQL, storing all structured data.
  - Scheduled ingestion reads from S3, processes data in Lambda or ECS, and writes it to the database.
  - CI/CD, secrets, and monitoring ensure smooth, reliable operation.

This approach makes the whole system scalable, reliable, and maintainable using fully managed AWS services.
